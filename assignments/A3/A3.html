			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>

                                    Overview (Male)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Provide an overview of all of the data provided, showing the general trends over time</li>
				<li>Male and Female numbers are roughly the same, so this should be just about the same as the chart for female numbers</li>
				<li>Shows the difference between the 1900 counts and 2000 counts</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
                                    Age 35 Comparison
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Directly compare the peak of the 2000 population range to the 1900 population</li>
				<li>It emphasises the growth in that range of the population in just 5 years</li>
				<li>It removes any distracting other data. However, these are not the same people from 1900 as in 2000</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img width="100%" src="sketch3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
                                    Age 35 Population, 1900 vs Age 45 Population, 2000
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Similar to the prior sketch, but showing the people who were 35 in 1900 and the growth in population of the same range of people after 10 years</li>
				<li>This is likely due to immigration. However, it is important to recognize both that there could be immigration away, as well as deaths in the population, so the difference isn't exactly the number of immigrants, but some underestimate</li>
				<li>It would be interesting to see this across all ranges of the population</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
      The first sketch is an overview of the data, simply putting almost all of
      the data points on a chart and connecting it with lines. This is useful
      as a starting point. However, the data alone is not enough to make a
      proper analysis. The second graph is a highlight on a particular age and
      provides a somewhat naive understanding of age changing with time.
      Understanding that it is the same people going from one age to another,
      with the exception of immigration and death brings us to the third chart.
      This shows how much the population has grown due to immigration in those
      ten years, because the country must have gained at least that number of
      people in the age range to grow to more than double.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

                        <p> This plot is a cummulation of the sketches, showing
                        the year 2000 population and the year 1900 population
                        adjusted so that someone born in 1900 will be seen as a
                        10 year old in the chart. This makes it possible to
                        find a lower bound on immigration to the US at
                        different ages, because that is the only way for the
                        population for ages over 10 to increase. The bars show
                        the lower bound on immigration by doing this
                        subtraction, but we can still see the raw population
                        values, with the 10 years at the beginning and end cut
                        off. This ignores all of the gender data, by summing
                        the genders populations. </p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
      This visualization is simple and clean, yet shows a lot about the ages of
      those who immigrated to the United States between 1900 and 2000. The
      simple calculation of shifting the 1900 ages up by ten and then
      subtracting them from the year 2000 population numbers made this
      possible. Continuing to show these intermediary steps helps compare the
      immigration numbers to the numbers overall in 1900 and 2000. The colors
      are clear and contrasting, and having a connected scatterplot for the
      overall populations and a bar chart for the immigration numbers helps
      keep them distinct.
      </p>
      <p>
      The sketching process was very useful in creating this final chart. I
      hadn't even considered immigration as being part of the data until I got
      to the second chart, wondering how the population could have grown by so
      much. For some reason, this idea wasn't intuitive to me. Playing with the
      data more makes it easier to see this idea, and then with the third
      sketch, I started to be able to emphasize the idea of immigration playing
      a part in the data. Finally, the computer generated chart brings it back
      to the first graph and adds in the new calculated idea, but for all of
      the age groups.
